# Graph-Traversal-Algorithms
Graph traversal visualization of BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's. BFS and Dijkstra showw the shortest path while DFS does not always show it.

## Introduction
This project was intended to help me with shortest path algorithms as well as practice using Qt and learn python syntax.

## Technologies
Python 3.9.10
Qt 5

## Acknowledgements
This project was inspired by the web version of Clement Mihailescu's algorithm visualizer.
